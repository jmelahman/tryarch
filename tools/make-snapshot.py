"""Take the migration snapshot the browser resumes from.

Boots the guest on a NATIVE build of the same qemu-wasm fork the
browser engine comes from, waits for init to reach the point where it
is spinning for the 9p share, and writes the VM state out with
`migrate`. See docs/engine.md for building the native binary and
docs/design.md for why the snapshot is taken there.

Both ends of a migration must agree on QEMU version, machine type and
device model, which is why nixpkgs' QEMU cannot take this snapshot: it
is a different major version from the fork.
