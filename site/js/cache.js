// A persistent cache for the bytes that never change: the qemu engine,
// the guest image, the snapshot, and every package file (a package
// filename names its exact version, and Arch never rebuilds one under
// the same name, so a cached package can never be stale).
//
// The Cache API is used rather than OPFS because these are all plain
// GETs and the entries are whole HTTP responses. Cross-origin packages
// are storable because the mirrors the site uses send CORS headers,
// which keeps the responses non-opaque.
//
// Reads and writes are deliberately separate calls. Handing `put` a
// `response.clone()` while streaming the original tees one body into
// two branches, and a rejected write — hitting the storage quota is the
// ordinary way that happens — errors the branch still being read, which
// surfaces as a bare "TypeError: Failed to fetch" partway through a
// download. So callers buffer the bytes themselves and store them
// afterwards, when nothing depends on the stream any more.
//
// Every call degrades to no caching at all: a private window, blocked
// site data, or a full quota costs a download, never an error.
